This directory contains the playbooks ran in the "Managing AWS with Ansible" Deep Dive course.   

To use these playbooks, you must first configure either keys.yml or keys.sh with appropriate values as demonstrated in the course content. 

Please be advised that most playbooks will need to be modified to run correctly with your own AWS environment.  Many of the instance, subnet, and other resource ID values used will need to be replaced with IDs from your own environment. 

The playbooks provide herein are for educational purposes only.
